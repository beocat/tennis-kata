# Tennis kata
Tennis kata in Ceylon

This is my Ceylon-remake of Ploehs solution of the tennis kata. You can find his solution here: https://github.com/ploeh/KataTennis

The solution builds on Ploehs blog-series _Types + Properties = Software_. It is a good read and I highly recommend it. You can find it here: http://blog.ploeh.dk/2016/02/10/types-properties-software/

I made this code while learning about both Type Driven Development and Ceylon so it might not be the most optimal solution and the code might not be idiomatic Ceylon. Also note that I looked a lot on Ploehs solution in F# so there are a lot of similarities.

Comments or questions are welcome.
